## New Shader

I logged in and started a new shader. I saw a code on the right side of the screen and
the output image on the left. In the current version of shadertoy. We get this starter code:

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;

    // Time varying pixel color
    vec3 col = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(iTime + uv.xyx + vec3(0,2,4));

    // Output to screen
    fragColor = vec4(col, 1.0);
}
```
The output looks like the following:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="starter_output" src="/images/shadertoy/b1/shadertoy_starter.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Output of the starter code"/>
<br/>

In the image above, in the bar, the things we see from left to write are:

1.  **Reset time button:** This button resets the time.
2.  **Play/Resume:** We play or stop the time.
3.  **Fps:** This part shows the fps we get while the shader is running.
4.  **Resolution:** This part gives the resolution of the framebuffer.

From the code, we can easily derive that the output color is changing according to time. But let's break everything down.

<br/>

First of all, the shader we write has a function called `mainImage`. This function takes two parameters and these are:

-   **out vec4 fragColor**: This is the output and it is the color of the fragment that is currently being processed.
-   **in vec2 fragCoord**: This is the coordinate of the fragment that is currently being processed.

What I understood from here is that in shadertoy, we are writing a **fragment shader** which is very similar to normal glsl. That means
shadertoy internally renders a single quad that covers the entire main framebuffer in the vertex shader and passes the texture coordinates of
the quad and it becomes the **fragCoord** vector. And then we code the **fragment shader** using that.

<br/>

Ok. So in the 4th line, we see `iResolution.xy`. This does not belong to the glsl language, so it looks like a uniform variable that is passed
to the shader internally. As the name suggests, it is a `vec2` and it represents the resolution of the framebuffer. So, in our case, the resolution
is 800x450. What is being done in line 4 is normalizing the fragCoords so they vary from 0 to 1. In addition, texture coordinates are just standard webgl
coordinates(bottom left is (0.0, 0.0) and top right it (1.0, 0.0)).

<br/>

In the 7th line, we calculate the color. We see another uniform that is `iTime`. It is the time we see on the bar of under the output screen. In line 10, we finally set
the fragColor to the color we calculated.
