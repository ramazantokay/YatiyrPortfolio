## New Shader

I logged in and started a new shader. I saw a code on the right side of the screen and
the output image on the left. In the current version of shadertoy. We get this starter code:

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;

    // Time varying pixel color
    vec3 col = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(iTime + uv.xyx + vec3(0,2,4));

    // Output to screen
    fragColor = vec4(col, 1.0);
}
```
The output looks like the following:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="starter_output" src="/images/shadertoy_starter.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Output of the starter code"/>
<br/>

In the image above, in the bar, the things we see from left to write are:

1.  **Reset time button:** This button resets the time.
2.  **Play/Resume:** We play or stop the time.
3.  **Fps:** This part shows the fps we get while the shader is running.
4.  **Resolution:** This part gives the resolution of the framebuffer.

From the code, we can easily derive that the output color is changing according to time. But let's break everything down.

<br/>

First of all, the shader we write has a function called `mainImage`. This function takes two parameters and these are:

-   **out vec4 fragColor**: This is the output and it is the color of the fragment that is currently being processed.
-   **in vec2 fragCoord**: This is the coordinate of the fragment that is currently being processed.

What I understood from here is that in shadertoy, we are writing a **fragment shader** which is very similar to normal glsl. That means
shadertoy internally renders a single quad that covers the entire main framebuffer in the vertex shader and passes the texture coordinates of
the quad and it becomes the **fragCoord** vector. And then we code the **fragment shader** using that.

<br/>

Ok. So in the 4th line, we see `iResolution.xy`. This does not belong to the glsl language, so it looks like a uniform variable that is passed
to the shader internally. As the name suggests, it is a `vec2` and it represents the resolution of the framebuffer. So, in our case, the resolution
is 800x450. What is being done in line 4 is normalizing the fragCoords so they vary from 0 to 1. In addition, texture coordinates are just standard webgl
coordinates(bottom left is (0.0, 0.0) and top right is (1.0, 0.0)).

<br/>

In the 7th line, we calculate the color. We see another uniform that is `iTime`. It is the time we see on the bar of under the output screen. In line 10, we finally set
the fragColor to the color we calculated.

## Circle

Now, it is time to write our code. Let's write our own code. This time, we will try to create a circle in the middle of the frame. For that,
we need an SDF for the circle. We write this code:

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;


    float d = length(uv);
    vec3 col = vec3(d,d,d);

    // Output to screen
    fragColor = vec4(col,1.0);
}
```

In the code above, we have measured the distance of current fragment's
normalized coordinate and wrote that as R,G and B colors of the output.
This means that, further we move away from the origin, color converges
to white. This is the output we get:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="circle1_output" src="/images/shadertoy_1_circle.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Circle field with bottom left origin"/>
<br/>

We wanted to make the middle of the screen to be the origin but the origin
is the bottom left corner since it is (0.0, 0.0) in texture coordinates. So,
we have to convert `uv` such that origin is (0.5,0.5). For that, we modify `uv`
like the following:

```cpp
vec2 uv = (fragCoord/iResolution.xy);

uv = uv*2.0 - 1.0;
...
```

With this, the bottom left corner becomes (-1.0,-1.0) and the top right corner becomes (1.0,1.0). The final
shader code looks like this:

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;
    uv = uv*2.0 - 1.0;

    float d = length(uv);
    vec3 col = vec3(d,d,d);

    // Output to screen
    fragColor = vec4(col,1.0);
}
```

We get the following after the modification:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="slightly wrong output" src="/images/shadertoy_1_ellipsoid.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Ellipsoid instead of a circle."/>
<br/>

Origin seems right in the middle but something is not right. Circle looks like it is squeezed into the y-axis. This is the
result of our aspect ratio. Since pixels on the x-axis are larger in number, we get the ellipsoid above when we normalize uv coordinates.

<br/>

To avoid this stretching thing, we have to depend on only one dimension of the resolution. So we modify our code like
this:

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;
    uv = uv*2.0 - 1.0;
    uv.x *= iResolution.x /iResolution.y;

    ...
}
```

This way, x coordinates are not stretched but they are also not normalized. They can be bigger than 1
because the width of the framebuffer is greater than the height. This code can be written
in just one line. For example, Inigo Quilez does this operation like the following:

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    vec2 uv = (2.0 * fragCoord - iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y;

    ...
}
```

This effectively does everything we need since the previous code did some redundant operations. Thus,
our image becomes like this:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="correct output" src="/images/shadertoy_1_correctCircleGradient.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Correct circle gradient"/>
<br/>

Now, it seems like we have solved the stretching problem. Now, let's draw an actual circle with a radius instead of a circular gradient.
First, as we learned in our geometry class in high school, the parametric equation of a circle is:

$$
    (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 \leq r^2
$$

In this equation, $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the x and y coordinates of circle's origin and
$$r$$ is the radius. By using this knowledge, let's write down a function that draws circles.


```cpp
float drawCircle(in vec2 pCoord, in vec2 pos, in float radius)
{
    return step(radius, length(pCoord - pos));
}

```

We give the function `pCoord`, `pos` and `radius` and respectively;

-   **pCoord** is the coordinate of the current fragment so we are whether this point is in the circle or not.
-   **pos** is the position of the circle's origin.
-   **radius** this is simply the radius of the circle

There is also a built-in function `step`. This function takes two parameters and if the second parameter is smaller than
the first the result becomes 0, otherwise, it becomes 1. So, in our case, `drawCircle` function is going to return
0.0 if `pCoord` is in the circle and 1.0 otherwise.

For example, if we want to draw a circle with a radius of 1.0 in the middle of the screen, we write this shader.

```cpp
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
{
    // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1)       
    vec2 uv = (2.0 * fragCoord - iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y;

    float d1 = drawCircle(uv, vec2(0.0,0.0), 1.0);  
        
    vec3 col = vec3(d1,d1,d1);
  

    // Output to screen
    fragColor = vec4(col,1.0);
}
```

Now, we get the circle like this:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="circle" src="/images/shadertoy_1_circle_step.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Correct with step"/>
<br/>

Finally, we managed to draw our first object in the shader. There is one small thing left to mention. If we look closely
we see some aliasing on the circumference of the circle. In 2D, we can use `smoothstep` function instead of `step`. This
function takes 3 parameters, and if the 3rd argument is between 1st and 2nd we get the interpolated result. Interpolation
is done between 0 and 1. If the 3rd argument is less than the first or bigger than the second, values are clamped between 0 and 1. This way, we can
get an antialiased circle. We have to modify our `drawCircle` function as follows:

```cpp
float drawCircle(in vec2 pCoord, in vec2 pos, in float radius)
{
    float epsilon = 0.01;
    return smoothstep(radius, radius + epsilon, length(pCoord - pos));
}
```

In this function, we define a small `epsilon` number and if the length is between `radius` and `radius + epsilon`, 
the result is interpolated between 0 and 1 on the circumference, so we get a smooth transition on the border. The
final image becomes like this:

<br/>
<ApiImage alt="circle" src="/images/shadertoy_1_circle_smoothstep.png" heigth="100%" width="100%" caption="Circle with smoothstep"/>
<br/>

### Closing notes

So, this was the start. Doing all that was actually easy but, I wanted to document it and it took some time. We can draw
other shapes too using their **SDF** functions but deriving and understanding them is hard for me. I will also make write
some blog posts under this series about some **SDF** functions that I clearly understood.
