## Introduction

While studying SDFs, I have learned that we combine different elements in the scene using **min** function.
But sometimes, we might want to blend those objects for artistic purposes. I saw that they do it a lot with
volumetric rendering.

<br/>

I have learned how it is implemented by reading the [article of Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/articles/smin/)
about smooth min function. In this article, he gives implementations of different smooth min functions and clearly
explains how they work. He also explains the derivation of **polynomial smooth min 2** function that he gave as
an example. To learn better, I would like to explain what I understood and document it in this blog post.

## Polynomial Smooth Min

In the article, the code for the smooth minimum function is the following:

```cpp
float smin( float a, float b, float k )
{
    float h = max( k-abs(a-b), 0.0 )/k;
    return min( a, b ) - h*h*k*(1.0/4.0);
}
```

So, in this code, **a** and **b** are some function values and **k** determines how smooth their minimum will be.
For example, let's think like this:

- let **a** be **f(x)**
- let **b** be **g(x)**

$$
    \begin{align}
        f(x) = \log_2x \\
        g(x) = -x + 5
    \end{align}
$$

These two functions look like the following:
