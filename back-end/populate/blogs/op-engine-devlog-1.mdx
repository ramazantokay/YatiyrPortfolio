## OP Engine Devlog

OP Engine is a game engine that is developed by me. It is in its baby steps. I have been watching @TheCherno's [Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) and learnt a lot about how game engines are built by looking at how he builds his **Hazel Engine**.

<br/>

### Intro

I first started implementing this project in early 2022 while watching him code public branch of **Hazel Engine** and learnt a lot. After finishing the series, I started making a lot of changes according to my needs and OP Engine started forming. It has:

- [x] OpenGL support
- [x] 3D PBR Graphics 
- [x] Shadow mapping for multiple lights (cascaded for directional lights)
- [x] Model loading and skeletal animations 
- [x] Scene management, entity component system
- [x] A level editor (OP Editor)
- [x] 3D Physics with Bullet Physics library
- [x] C# scripting support with mono

<br/>

### Current State

Here is a demo of the engine:

<br/>

In addition, I have implemented boids algorithm using the engine and here is the simulation:

This engine actually acts as a testbed which helps me learn important concepts especially in graphics programming. As I improve myself, I will add new things and keep track of my progress will devlogs. I wish I started writing devlogs earlier but no worries, I have a lot of things in my mind which needs to be implemented and improved.

I want to implement most of the techniques and algorithms so I learn how the work. In the current state of the engine and level editor, we can build scenes and run simulations, it has performance issues that I am going to address later.
