## Shaders and Shadertoy

I have been writing shaders for my [OP Engine](/blog/op-engine-devlog-1) for a while.
I have also tried to make a [Raytracer](/blog/my-ray-tracer-journey-1) with shaders but failed because
I had no free time to work on a shader-based ray tracer. So I finished the project by implementing a path
tracer that works on the CPU. But I know that I have to get serious with shaders and learn everything I can
also considering the maths behind the concepts.

<br/>

[Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) is a website that runs on WebGL.
It is created by [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/) and [Pol Jeremias Vila](https://www.poljeremias.com/).
People write shaders and share their work with others. As I understood,
the purpose is to create stuff, share and let people learn 3D computer graphics.
Since 2021, I have been looking at shaders written by shadertoy creators. They implement
mesmerizing fractals, procedural scenes, pathtracers and other cool stuff. For example,
the image of clouds on the top of the page is a frame of a shader created by [nimitz](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/nimitz).

<br/>

As another example, Inigo Quilez created the scene shown below with distance fields that work in real-time and the [scene](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ld3Gz2) is available in shadertoy. But
we should not open this shader on smartphones because their power is not enough to run the shader
which causes a crash:

<br/>

Another example that I found nice is this [galaxy shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MslGWN) by CBS. It makes use of fractals.
Colors also change according to the input which is the music played on another channel.

<br/>

There are tons of mesmerizing pieces of art created with shadertoy which inspires and
encourages beginners to take action and learn. So in this series, I will try to learn
and record my progress with blog posts.
